# ESB Arquitectural Patterns

## Introduction

In the following article we want to show the use of apache serviceMix which is a container among which has features such as ActiveMQ, Kafar among others. The objective of this laboratory is to show a pattern of ESB architecture which will be developed in the Java language and deployed in an AWS (Amazon Web Services).
